The repository deals with access issues on a case-by-case basis.,"The access policy is not formally defined, but there are some repeatable procedures in place; data access processes follow a regular pattern - they have developed to the stage where similar procedures are followed by different people undertaking the same task.","An access policy is defined and is connected to specific processes and procedures; the policy is in conformance with the OECD recommendations and guidelines on data access (OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding, OECD 2007).",The access policy is monitored and measured for compliance with processes and procedures; actions are taken where processes appear not to be working effectively or not to be in accordance with the policy.,Access policy is regularly reviewed and updated based on technology watch and formalised communication with users / Designated Community.,
Access,RA,2.3.2.1,"Failures, anomalies, system failures","The repository logs and reviews all errors, access management failures and anomalies (in order to identify security threats and access management system failures).Â",,No logs or reviews of failures.,"Some awareness of the need to handle and review access failures and anomalies; issues are solved and recorded on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis; no formalised procedures or logs/protocols are in place.","Failures and anomalies are repeatedly solved and recorded in specific ways, but there are no written procedures or process descriptions in place; logs may exists but they are incomplete and lacks a common, formalised framework.","All access management failures and anomalies are logged, recorded and reviewed in a systematic way; processes and procedures for error handling are formalised and documented.","All logs, processes, procedures and handling of anomalies and errors are regularly reviewed and updated.",All systems are regularly reviewed and updated; system checks and reviews should be able to identify possible security threats before they occur (predictive).,
Access,RA,2.3.2.2,Persistent identifiers (PIDs) / locators,"The repository uses externally visible, standardised persistent identifiers to ensure reliable tracing of data and metadata.Â",,No system or policy for persistent identification,"There is some awareness of the need for persistent identifiers and locators, but actions are sporadic and ad hoc; there are no formalised systems, processes or procedures in place.","Mechanisms and systems for identification and location are partly in place, but does not comply with formalised DOI systems; mechanisms are being repeatedly used, but there is lack of formalisation and written procedures.","There are mechanisms and systems in place for persistently identify and locate data and metadata (either by following external systems like DOI, or by internal PID systems); all processes and procedures are documented and formalised.",PID systems and locators are regularly reviewed and updated; mechanisms are aligned to higher level preservation goals and plans.,"All mechanisms and functions are monitored and measured; there are systemised reviews and updates of PID systems based on technology watch and formal, regular communication with Designated Community.",
Access,RA,2.3.2.3,Authentication and authorisation,The repository uses AAI (Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure) or other direct or federated user authentication approaches to control access to data.,,No authentication approach in place.,"There is some awareness of the need to implement authentication approaches; access control is performed on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis.",An authentication infrastructure emerges by repeated use of authentication approaches; lacks standardisation and formalisation.,"The repository uses digital identities, identity management, authentication, authorisation to control access to data; AAI is formalised, systematised and documented.","All AAI mechanisms and functions are measured, assessed and regularly reviewed and updated.","All AAI mechanisms and functions are monitored and measured; there are systemised reviews and updates of PID systems based on technology watch and formal, regular communication with Designated Community and other relevant stakeholders.",
